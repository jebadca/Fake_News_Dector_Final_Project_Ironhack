# Fake_News_Dector_Final_Project_Ironhack
The goal of this project is to classify news as either likely true or likely fake based on a dataset of over 60,000 news articles, approximately half of which are true and half of which are fake. The articles used in the training data have been labeled as true / fake by the organization PolitiFact and come from different news sources.
